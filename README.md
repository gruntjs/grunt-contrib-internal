> Internal tasks for managing the grunt-contrib project.


_Note that this is not an official Grunt plugin release! If you want to use this in a project, please be sure to follow the instructions for installing development versions, as outlined in the [Installing Grunt](http://gruntjs.com/installing-grunt) guide._


## Getting Started
This plugin requires Grunt `~0.4.0`

If you haven't used [Grunt](http://gruntjs.com/) before, be sure to check out the [Getting Started](http://gruntjs.com/getting-started) guide, as it explains how to create a [Gruntfile](http://gruntjs.com/sample-gruntfile) as well as install and use Grunt plugins. Once you're familiar with that process, you may install this plugin with this command:

```shell
npm install grunt-contrib-internal --save-dev
```

Once the plugin has been installed, it may be enabled inside your Gruntfile with this line of JavaScript:

```js
grunt.loadNpmTasks('grunt-contrib-internal');
```

_This plugin is used internally by grunt-contrib plugins, and shouldn't be used externally._
